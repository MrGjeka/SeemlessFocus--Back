SeemlessFocus Chrome Extension
SeemlessFocus is a productivity-focused Chrome extension designed to help students, professionals, and anyone who works on a computer maintain focus by seamlessly integrating Spotify music into their workflow. The extension connects directly to the Spotify API, allowing users to log in, access their playlists, and automatically play music when there is no other audio playing (e.g., when a lecture pauses). The AI-powered audio detection ensures a continuous and effortless background music experience.
